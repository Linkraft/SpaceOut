# SpaceOut
SpaceOut! is a sci-fi reimagining of the classic Atari game Breakout! Players are tasked with blasting away an invading UFO set on destroying the Earth with a ship that moves at lightspeed. It utilizes Processing, a Java-based language, and was created by me for my Introduction to Digital Arts and Sciences class at the University of Florida.

## Dependencies
- [Processing 3.4](https://processing.org/reference/)
- [ControlP5 library](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/)

## Usage
To start, navigate in the Processing program UI to Sketch -> Import Library -> Add Library, then search for ControlP5 and install it. Then start the program by opening up any of the files and pressing the Run button in the top left.

## Story
You have three fighter ships to destroy a hostile UFO heading for Earth at lightspeed!
You have to blast the UFO away in one volley, or else it will regenerate and you will
have to try again! Because you are battling an alien starcraft at lightspeed, if your 
fighter ship does not constantly return to the mothership after blasting bits of the 
UFO away, it may become lost to the stars beyond, so be sure to move the mothership 
around to stay close to your fighter ship.

## Gameplay
#### Controls
1. To move the paddle use the left and right arrow keys.
2. To pause the game, press `P`
3. To reset the game, press `R` or the reset button under the play button

#### Notes
The ball will speed up gradually over time, about once every 4.5 seconds.
I also threw in a couple end screens for whether or not the player destroys the UFO.
Because of this, I'd appreciate it if you could play the game by winning and losing to see
both screens. :)
   
(...or just fiddle with my code to force a win, that works too...)

## Documentation
This project only asked for me to recreate Breakout!, not make a whole videogame with a life system, end screens, and images. As such, if you interested in the core mechanics of how the game functions, please check out the `Project4.pdf` file for more information.

## Timeframe
This project was completed in the fall of 2018 and took around 8-12 hours to complete.

## Acknowledgements
The shader used for the background of the game comes from [this page](http://glslsandbox.com/e#49809.3) on GLSL sandbox.
All images used come from Google Images by typing in "500 x 500 starship" or "500 x 500 space".
